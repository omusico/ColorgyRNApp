# Redux Persist - Except "ing"s

Ignore event states that contains "ing", avoids stalemate occured by app restarting during events (something like `{ profileRefreshing: true }`).

Note: redux-persist-immutable works with nested immutable data at the reducer level. It does not if the entire state atom is one immutable map.

## Usage

```js
import { compose } from 'redux';
import { persistStore, autoRehydrate } from 'redux-persist';
import reduxPersistExpectIngs from 'redux-persist-except-ings';

const reducer = combineReducers(reducers);
const store = compose(autoRehydrate(), createStore)(reducer);

persistStore(store, { transforms: [reduxPersistExpectIngs] });
```
